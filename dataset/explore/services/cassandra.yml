  description: The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
    and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
    proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the
    perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating
    across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your
    users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.
