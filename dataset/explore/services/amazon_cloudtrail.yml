  description: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational
    auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log,
    continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your
    AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity,
    including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command
    line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis,
    resource change tracking, and troubleshooting. In addition, you can use CloudTrail
    to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts. These capabilities help simplify
    operational analysis and troubleshooting.
